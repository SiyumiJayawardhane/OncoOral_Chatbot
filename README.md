Setting Up Environment Variables
To use this chatbot, you'll need access to the Gemini API. Follow these steps to set up your own .env file:

Get your Gemini API Key

Visit Google AI Studio

Sign in with your Google account and generate an API key

Create a .env file in the root directory of this project
Inside the file, add the following line:

env
Copy
Edit
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
Don't share this file
The .env file is listed in .gitignore to prevent accidentally exposing your API key in version control.
